# MelgramCNN

MelgrammCNN is a Convolutional Neural Network used in a regression setting. Features are extractracted from MelSpectrograms to predict the `remaining_time_left` given acoustic signals emmited by a laboratory fault. This is a two step process:

(1) Generate MelSpectrograms given acoustic data

(2) Train a CNN on Generated MelSpectrograms.

(3) Predict `remaining_time_left` given a 150,000 size sample of acoustic data. 


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.


### And coding style tests
