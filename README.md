# MelgramCNN

MelgrammCNN is a Convolutional Neural Network used for a regression task. Features are extractracted from MelSpectrograms to predict the `remaining_time_left` given acoustic signals emmited by a laboratory fault. This process is as follows:

(1) Generate MelSpectrograms given acoustic data

(2) Train a CNN on Generated MelSpectrograms.

(3) Predict `remaining_time_left` given a 150,000 size sample of acoustic data.
